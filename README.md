# 🙏🏽 Maria Reyes | Software Developer • Game Creator • Child of God

Hello! My name is **Maria Reyes**. I’m a child of God who lives by the Word and walks by the Spirit. I am a self-taught developer with a creative heart, currently exploring how technology and storytelling can be used for good. I express myself through faith-led coding projects, line dancing, and a love for uplifting storytelling (especially in K-dramas and Korean action movies like *Ballerina*).

I believe in developing with **purpose and patience**, and I strive to live out the **fruits of the Spirit** in all I do:  
**Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Gentleness, and Self-Control.**

## 🌱 My Journey So Far

I took my first computer programming class in high school and was hooked by how coding lets me express my creativity.  

Starting my own app and game from scratch was intimidating at first. I didn’t know where to begin — but the Lord led me through it, and I’ve now formed an incredible team. I’m so proud of what we’ve accomplished together so far.

## 🎯 Vision

I hope to one day **found my own game development company** — a place where dreamers with no technical background can bring their game ideas to life.

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I'm always open to learning more and joining teams where I can grow, serve, and contribute with joy.
